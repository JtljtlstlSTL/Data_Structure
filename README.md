## Common and Fundamental Data Structures

This project also includes implementations and notes of some **common and fundamental data structures**, which are the backbone of algorithm design and computer science learning.  
The main structures we cover are:

- **Array** – continuous memory storage, basic but powerful.  
- **Linked List** – dynamic memory structure for flexible insertions and deletions.  
- **Stack & Queue** – linear data structures with LIFO/FIFO access patterns.    
- **Tree & Binary Search Tree (BST)** – hierarchical structures for ordered data.  
- **Graph** – versatile structure for modeling networks and relationships.

These data structures are the **foundation of problem solving**, and mastering them is essential before diving into advanced algorithms or competition problems.
